# Cinemix - React Movie App

This is a personal React project. This fully responsive app will allow you to find your favourite movies and save them to your watchlist. You can check the latest, top or upcoming movies or search the films you want with the searchbar at the top.
Click on a movie to view the movie information which includes a short description, trailers and much more.

The movie data was retrieved from [The Movie Database - TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

While developing this project I really learned and understood challenging concepts such as managing the global state with **useContext**, **useReducer** and **useParams** hooks.
This is also the first project where I implemented the use of **Tailwind CSS** together with **DaisyUI** components and I have become proficent with them.
